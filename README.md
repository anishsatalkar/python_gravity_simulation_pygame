# python_gravity_simulation_pygame
A simple implementation which simulates gravity in Python using pygame.
There are two files, one which uses pure Python lists and classes and the other uses numpy. Numpy implementation is around 70-80x faster than the pure Python implementation.

## Dependencies
1. pygame
2. numpy (for the numpy file)

## Additional Info
You may delete the part of code which prints the text (mass of each object over it) to make the simulation cleaner.
